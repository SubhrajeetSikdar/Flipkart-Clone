# CSS Utility Classes

This repository contains CSS utility classes that can be used to quickly style HTML elements. These classes provide convenience for common styling tasks such as flexbox alignment, button styling, margin adjustments, and text alignment.

## Contents

- `style.css`: The CSS file containing utility classes.
  
## Utility Classes

### .flex-all-center

This class sets the display property to flex and aligns items both horizontally and vertically at the center using justify-content and align-items properties.

### .btn

The `.btn` class styles elements to resemble buttons. It sets padding, text color, background color, border, and border-radius properties. It also sets the cursor property to pointer for better UX.

### .my-1, .my-2

These classes adjust the margin of elements. `.my-1` adds a small margin of 5px on the top and bottom, while `.my-2` adds a larger margin of 26px.

### .text-center

This class aligns text to the center using the text-align property.

## Usage

To use these utility classes, simply add the desired class to your HTML elements. For example:

```html
<div class="flex-all-center">
    <button class="btn">Click me</button>
</div>

<p class="my-1">Some text here</p>
<p class="my-2">Some more text here</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <p>This text is centered.</p>
</div>
